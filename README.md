Car Rental System README
Overview
The Car Rental System is a comprehensive console-based application developed in C++ designed to facilitate the management of car rentals for a small to medium-sized rental service. This system allows users to rent and return cars, displaying available cars excluding those currently rented. It incorporates improved user interaction, input validation, customer management, advanced car filtering, and data persistence through file handling.

Features
Car Management: Easily manage a fleet of cars with details such as make, model, year, and daily rental rate. The system supports adding new cars to the fleet and updating their rental status dynamically.
Rental Process: Users can rent available cars by selecting from a list of cars that are not currently rented. The system updates the car's status to ensure it does not appear available for rent until returned.
Return Process: Allows users to return rented cars, making them available for rent again. This process is streamlined to ensure efficiency and accuracy.
Display Available Cars: Users can view a list of all cars that are currently available for rent, providing transparency and ease of selection.
Customer Management: Tracks customers who rent cars, enhancing the ability to manage and analyze rental patterns and customer preferences.
Data Persistence: Utilizes file handling to persist car and rental information between sessions, ensuring data is not lost when the system is closed.
Input Validation: Incorporates robust input validation to prevent errors and ensure that user inputs are correctly processed, enhancing usability and system stability.

How to Use
Starting the System: Run the application, and you will be greeted with a menu of options, including renting a car, returning a car, displaying available cars, and exiting the system.
Renting a Car: Select the option to rent a car, enter your name, and choose from the list of available cars. Follow the prompts to complete the rental process.
Returning a Car: Choose the option to return a car and enter the index of the car you are returning as indicated in your rental agreement.
Viewing Available Cars: At any point, you can view the current list of cars available for rent by selecting the appropriate menu option.
Exiting: To exit the system, select the option from the menu. Your actions up until this point will be saved for future sessions.

Technical Details
Language: Developed in C++, ensuring high performance and efficient memory management.
Data Storage: Uses simple file handling for data persistence, storing car details and rental status in a text file (cars.txt).
Modular Design: Features a clean, modular design, making it easy to extend with additional functionalities such as advanced filtering or integration with databases for larger scale applications.
C++ Development: Demonstrates proficiency in C++ with a focus on object-oriented programming, file I/O, and system design.
System Design: Showcases the ability to design and implement a complete system from the ground up, including planning, development, and testing.
Software Practices: Utilizes best practices such as modular design, data encapsulation, and input validation to create a robust and user-friendly application.

Conclusion
The Car Rental System is a versatile application designed to meet the needs of car rental businesses. It combines functionality with simplicity, offering an intuitive interface for users and a solid foundation for developers looking to build or extend upon it. Whether you're a recruiter looking for a talented C++ developer or a developer seeking to understand system design and implementation in C++, this project serves as an excellent reference and starting point.
